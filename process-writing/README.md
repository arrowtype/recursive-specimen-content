# Recursive: Origins & Process

_Written by Stephen Nixon_

## A typographic pallette for code & UI

Recursive is a type family made primarily for use in programming and software user interfaces. Its letterforms are inspired by single-stroke casual signpainting but simplified in order to allow effective, highly-legible usage in text sizes, with a special focus on providing typographic flexibility and expressive range on screens and on the web. It was first conceived & designed as my thesis project at TypeMedia 2018, a one–year MA program in type design at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Netherlands. This year, Google Fonts sponsored the completion of the project for release under the Open Font License.

So far, Recursive has received over 10 months of intense, full-time focus from me, as well as about 4 months of combined effort from collaborators. It is a complex project. Typical digital type families are a series of individual font files, which might have the four "RIBBI" styles (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic), or if they get more elaborate may generate extra font weights as interpolations of a slightly-wider range drawn in four or six "master" source files. Recursive, meanwhile, is built from 24 font masters which are compiled into a single, ultra-flexible variable font [1] file with 5 stylistic axes.

Managed in Git version-control software from the start, Recursive has received nearly 2,000 commits from 5 contributors. Modern-day type design is a surprisingly multi-discliplinary field in which practicioners commonly split their time between type drawing, graphic design, and coding. Throughout the project, I coded as a way to automate my workflow, generate test proofs of the work-in-progress, check source files for quality, build design files into working variable fonts, and use the output fonts in web experiments. Along the way, I used the current versions of Recursive Mono as my primary font in code editors. This, in turn, was a way to test the font itself, interogating the design as worked with it. By using the font outputs as a tool to produce the font, I was working _recursively_ – using outputs as inputs to achieve a result that would have otherwise been impossible.

## Goals of the project

The project has been driven by three primary goals:

1. Making something that would provide the most utility (and fun) to developers and designers
2. Exploring what is possible with variable fonts, beyond the usual "weight, width, and filesize saving" aspects that people tend to focus on.
3. Chasing a personal curiosity: what might a "casual script" for code should look like?

## My background

Ultimately, Recursive has been a way to explore & combine several things I love: beautiful letterforms, web design & development, and font technology.

I grew up in Rapid City, in the Black Hills of South Dakota. It was a beautiful place to grow up, but not exactly an epicenter of design. I had an early love of letters, drawing the logos of sports teams and imagining the brands for speculative car companies, and later making T-shirts and flyers for the rock bands I played in. I was passionate about many things, but making logos and lettering was the one thing I could focus on more than any other. It wasn't until a high school art class that I realized graphic design was an actual career possibility with real colleges dedicated to the subject, and I eventually went to the College of Design at the University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities (UMN) for Graphic Design. In college, it was a similar revelation that type design itself was a career and that educational programs like KABK TypeMedia existed.

During my time at the UMN, I studied a wide range of subjects in graphic design, but leaned most into typography and technology classes. For my senior thesis, I designed a type family, Warehouse, based on the historical signage in downtown Minneapolis. This typeface took inspiration from two main forms of lettering in ghost signage – one part of the family was  "Warehouse Gothic," with shapes similar to many classic sans-serifs designs, while a complementary part of the family was "Warehouse Square," which had letters that were rectangular with rounded corners. To distribute Warehouse and two other display fonts I had made as side-projects, I designed and built a website (which is miraculously [still available on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170720054923/http://www.fourthfloorfoundry.com/index.html)). Thought there are clearly similarities between Warehouse and Recursive, I was months into this project before realizing that it was, in part, a progression of my earlier thesis project.

After graduating from the UMN, I moved to New York City and worked as a designer at IBM for 3 years. At IBM, I was a visual designer for software, and subsequently a brand experience designer. 

While designing software, my longest-running project was making financial dashboards for executives. Amongst many other things, I learned a ton about using type for software interfaces. IBM used Helvetica Neue at that time, and I grew to understand both its strengths and limitations. In some ways, Helvetica was a great typeface to work with, because it was easy to fit a lot of content into relatively small spaces, and things looked cohesive and classic when set in all-Helvetica. However, there were downsides to using Helvetica in software design: its tight spacing and small apertures made it hard to read at small sizes, its default figures weren't tabular and so it was hard to use in data-heavy tables. As a ubiquitous font in modern-day visual culture, it could also tend to lead to design that looked bland and uninspired. Through many hours of trial-and-error while making mockups, I also discovered less-obvious limitations. I didn't have a matching monospace font to work with, so even if I did want to use a monospace font for tabular data or to present strings like passwords, these wouldn't match the sizing or style of our primary type. Each font style took up different widths (the bold was wider than the light), so I found that we couldn't change font styles to show state in menus or links – I had to rely solely on cues like color and object movement for "microinteractions" to communicate interactivity to users. The mixed availability of Helvetica was another challenge – I had Helvetica on my Mac computer, but teammates and users with PCs weren't even seeing the same typeface that I spent my time designing with, but rather, seeing fallbacks. We didn't serve webfonts because that would slow down loading times and the fallback fonts were "close enough" for most people, anyway.

After my time designing software UI, I moved into the role of a brand experience designer in IBM's artifical intelligence division, IBM Watson. I made this change at a really fortuitous time: the company's core brand team was just starting to roll out new branding for Watson, and I was able to help implement this on everything from conference merch to Watson webpages to app icons. Around the same time, IBM also started to change over from Helvetica to IBM Plex, an incredible type family designed for IBM by Mike Abbink and Bold Monday. Getting to work with Plex was a total delight: it took a fresh look at IBM's rich design history, but offered a solution tailored to suit the huge range of needs across software, web, and services. IBM had ordered the type family a custom project, so they controlled the licensing and made it open source, making it easy for every IBMer (and anyone else) to have copies of the right fonts to use in making and experiencing IBM products. Even better, Mike Abbink and IBM's core brand team used the introduction of Plex to transform the company's visual & graphic design as a whole. This was a powerful lesson in how transformative it can be to have type that is well-suited to the task of designing for software and the web.

Through my time at IBM, I also learned a lot beyond typography. I was a designer rather than a developer, but I found I was often most effective when I got closer to the code. Over my time there, I went from spending almost my design time in visual design tools to spending almost half of my design time in code, bringing the design work from others into production CSS and prototyped JavaScript for developers to use in building marketing webpages.

Aside from finding code to be a useful tool for design, I simply love to code. It doesn't come as naturally to me as it might to others, but when I solve a problem in code, it lights up my brain in a way that nothing else can. 

I have a special love of the web – especially the people, communities, and philosophies of web development. I love the many fun, warm-hearted resources for people wanting to grow as web developers – sites like CSS Tricks and MDN, tools like CodePen and CodeSandbox, frameworks like GatsbyJS, and podcasts like Syntax FM, Toolsday, and ShopTalkShow. I love that by and large, web development is a welcoming field, embraces experimentation, and strives to keep user needs as the basis of how things work.

Along side my work at IBM and my efforts to learn to code, I spent time practicing lettering and type design. I made lettering for posters and events at work, I made type experiements inspired by the letters of New York City, and I even painted a couple of murals for small businesses in Brooklyn. I attended type events and workshops in the city and tried to chase followers and likes on Instagram (where I found that people had a strange attraction to anything based on brush scripts – and that I did, too). For much of those 3 years working, I dreamed of making it into TypeMedia and pursuing type design seriously. I applied after my first year of working, but didn't make it in. I worked hard, got in more design experience, and upgraded my portfolio for the next year's application ... and I made it in for the 2017–2018 class!

TypeMedia is a yearly program that brings together 12 students from around the world focus on many aspects of type design. In the first semester, classes cover topics like type revival, stonecarving, creating original type families, and coding in Python to produce & test type. In the second semester, each student focuses on a thesis project and develops this with regular feedback and critique from professors, peers, and visiting designers. 

This "pressure cooker" of a course is an intensive 10-months, but this environment has helped produce many amazing type designers and original typefaces. Many of the designers who lead TypeMedia studied under Gerrit Noordzij, a type designer & educator who elegantly described a theory that different forms of writing can be the basis of original & flexible type systems. Because of this legacy, many of the typefaces produced as TypeMedia thesis projects have a connection to calligraphic forms of writing. 

The teachers that lead TypeMedia are themselves accomplished type designers, who have contributed greatly to the theory and technology of the industry. They do a great deal to pass on their knowledge to students and to help students explore and learn for themselves – and I attended the program at a good time to do just that. Variable fonts are a relatively old idea, but they have only really been feasible to design and use in the past few years. My class of TypeMedia was one of the first or second for which the technology was actually feasible to design for, so several of my classmates and I dove into the topic to explore how we could make projects to explore the expanded outer limits of fonts.

Recursive comes from my experiences as a designer, wishing for a typeface that just worked *better* in software. It is my effort to make something new, useful, and fun for the web development community. Recursive comes from my love for brush lettering and the diverse signage of NYC. Recursive comes from TypeMedia, where it was a way to explore both the theory of type from handwritten strokes and the technological advances in type design.


## The underlying idea

I had obviously been thinking about what to do in my TypeMedia thesis for a long time before starting the program, and in the first semester, I thought I knew exactly the project I would end the year with. However, throughout the year, my classmates and I asked teachers, alumni, and visiting designers for advice, and this shifted my opinion. A few comments stood out above the rest. 

We were often told to embrace something weird and ambitious, forgetting notions of making something to immediately define and sell, because it is such a rare opportunity to spend 5 months with such complete focus on one project. One alum who returned to teach a workshop said something like, "now that variable fonts exist, you should approach type design completely differently." They left it up to us to imagine just *how* we should approach it differently, but that was the point. We weren't supposed to get answers from those before us; we were supposed to seek our own.

And so, I sketched new ideas for my thesis. One that I kept coming back to was a single-stroke casual. This is a genre of writing which I have found to be extremely appealing for as long as I have been paying attention to lettering and signpainting. Each signpainter has their own version of it, but it adheres to some typical attributes: it's usually written a slant, it's often written in all-caps, it uses a limited set of simple-to-paint strokes to create letters that are lively and warm, and usually "low waisted" construction. Often, if casual caps are paired with a lowercase, they are painted in a connected script. Drawing casual letters with a brush pen in my notebook made me realize that I could squish and stretch them wildly, and they still held up their energy and sense of excitement. 

As someone who loves not just the act of coding but also its aesthetic – particularly the way that monospaced type creates a tabular rhymtm by compressing some letters and extending others – I also started sketching casual caps and scripts as fixed-width letters. Lo and behold, they kept their magnetic pull on my eyeballs.

![](images/recursive-notebook_sketch-pseudo.jpg)

In TypeMedia, I was very lucky to have two classmates (Gen Ramirez & Seán Donohoe) who are skillful signpainters. They taught the rest of us useful lessons in basic letter painting. With their help, I learned to practice brush painting with acrylic paint on windows and paper. With this approach, I interspersed painting throughout the semester, to keep my ideas rooted in the source material, even while I did much of the sketching with a simpler-to-control brush pen. I sought to develop my own style of casual letters, and I found inspiration from many signpainters, including:

- John Downer: https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWK9p6BDdG/
- Sthlm Signs: https://www.instagram.com/p/BZv4hf1lrrY/
- Copenhagen Signs: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxbz-aBHof5/
- Mike Meyer: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx5AHOJh9Mv/
- Ged Palmer: https://www.instagram.com/p/BkhVzMoF8OQ/
- Petra D: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc15OdlBepj/

Not only was I seeking to find my own style of casual letters, but I wanted to make a lowercase that was a typical "Roman," rather than a connected script, and I wanted to create letters that weren't just copying signpainting, but which were more "typographic" – simplified in visual style and overall curvature, and properly adapted to screens. 

The concept & design of Recursive is very rooted in the idea that every stroke of every letter should come from what a signpainter could produce with a brush. This approach enabled me to explore a system that could morph in proportion, expression, weight, and slant, but still remain cohesive and tied to its initial inspiration. 


## My design approach

- Prototyping atop Plex mono to test the idea. I also tested another totally different idea (which I still intend to make as a future project), but ultimately went with this weirder one. YOt]mO!

[IMAGE OF FIRST PROTOTYPE]

- Scrapping the prototype, but largely keeping the metrics to stay consistent with other mono fonts. Allows fallbacks during design phase

[IMAGE OF EARLY PROTOTYPE WITH FALLBACKS]

- Early drawings. Searching for something both expressive and simple/typographic. Tried to explore this by making something too wild, and something too rigid. Realized that having a spectrum was more interesting than finding just one thing in the middle. I recieved some excellent feedback from a couple of type designers I look up to especially, and this gave me a boost of ideas to refine the letterforms – making them wild but not _too_ wild, and straightforward but not naïve.

[IMAGE OF PROTOTYPE SHOWN DURING ROBOTHON]

## Development at TypeMedia

- [NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT THIS...] I designed Recursive in RoboFont, a font editor that is sometimes intimidating for newcomers, but really encourages customization of one's workflow with scripts, extensions, and the UFO (Unified Font Object) file format. 

- Inventing my own casual alphabet, with different brushes and pens. Taking uppercase forms into a roman lowercase. Lots of sketching with brush pens led me to find some details that aren't common from professional signpainters, but which I think work well, anyway. Little "kicks" are added to letters like `R` and `K`, but left out of lowercase letters like `k` and `x`, to improve readability (because the vast majority of running text is set in lowercase).

[SKETCHES]

- Narrowing focus. Experimenting with connected scripts and blackletters, but leaving these aside out of (a small amount) of practicality.

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF DIFFERENT STYLES]

- Expanding weight range. The heavy was too good to ignore. Most type designers say that the weight range of monospace designs are limited by what complex characters can do. I disagree. 😈 "Sporklike" contrast and overall color
  - I initially worked on a grid that sought to make this typeface "pixel fit" at 10px on a retina screen. (This is a classic way for fonts to start, only for the designer to realize that grid-fitting is a slightly silly goal for fonts, as they will show up at all sizes on all manner of screen resolutions, and rendering technology is made to optimize shapes as much as possible, for each device.)
  - Still, this 20-unit grid approach did help me to come to a decision on the "Designspace," or stylistic range of the type family. The lightest weight is drawn so that strokes take up roughly 1/20th of their total height, so that fonts can be as light as possible while avoiding super-light text which is that so often the bane of readability on the web. The heaviest weight is drawn so that counters (the white spaces in the middle of letters) take up 1/20th of the text block – making something as heavy as possible while retaining legibility at screen text sizes.

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF HEAVY STYLES]

- Finding the right balance of personality and typographic harmony.

  - How big should corner curves be?
  - How much overshoot should stroke connections have?

- Making curviness match between letters like /n and /o – finding that low connections and bouncy contrast could help with this

[IMAGES: EARLY /n & /o VERSUS CURRENT /n & /o (maybe a word like `sonorous`?)]

- Made a chrome extension to inject my font into any page, and read with it. (This has since been turned into Type-X, but more on this later).

[EARLY VERSION OF TYPE-X][current version of type-x]

- Paying attention to text rendering by using the fonts. Smoothing kinks from Linear styles to make them as seemlessly readable as possible – avoiding visual "breaks" or whitespots in letters
- Making a sans by scripting some Glyphs to copy over but leaving others to draw/adjust
- Producing materials for the TypeMedia thesis: specimens, poster, process book, and a simple web type tester

## After TypeMedia

- Further developing the recursive minisite as a way to better understand react/Gatsby and as a better way to show the project to others
- Making my TypeMedia class website
- I started freelancing, primarily at Google Fonts, working on variable font upgrades and onboarding, to upgrade existing fonts like Encode, and onboard new, popular fonts like Fira Code and Inter.
- I established my type design & development company, Arrow Type (named for some of the most useful but most-often forgotten glyphs in type design).
- Discovered a critical issue with Recursive that I had missed TypeMedia by only working on a 4K monitor. I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally, overlapping contours in each letter to mimick the strokes of a brush, painting these letters. This approach enhanced my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, but it had a major drawback on lower-resolution screens: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way. This was due to each contour getting "antialiased," and these partially-lit pixels overlapping and adding up in value.

[IMAGE: EXAMPLE OF OVERLAP ISSUE]

## Deciding to release through Google Fonts

- I had been planning to work on Recursive as a side project, and eventually release it either through Arrow Type or through a more establish type foundry. However, because Google Fonts is in the process of pushing their library further into the realm of variable fonts, they offered to sponsor me to finish Recursive and release it sooner, as an OFL (open-source) font.
- In the type industry, Google Fonts is somewhat controversial. Does it devalue the industry to have so many free options? I discussed my options with a few trusted type designers.
- Ultimately, I decided that for Recursive, Google Fonts was an ideal place to release. This typeface is for coders of all abilities and experiences, code documentation, and to push new ideas forward in variable type on the web, software, and end users. It could be a niche product that i made a side project for 5 years, or it could make an impact and be published within 2019.
- As a quick plug for commercially-released type: as biased as I am towards Recursive, there are still lots of benefits in favor of buying type. If you are branding a company, the typeface you select will do a lot of work to help or hinder your ability to communicate, connect, and differentiate. This is a choice that should be carefully considered for every project, and ultimately, the cost of licensing type is almost always extremely reasonable for the value it can add to a project.
  - In the realm of Recursive, if you are a professional coder, you probably spend hours every day with your chosen monospace font as your primary interface. You (or your employer) probably paid some good money to buy a computer, an office chair, and a desk that would allow you to maximize focus and productivity. It's worth finding (and buying, if applicable) a typeface that is best for you and can do the same! There are a number of _masterful,_ modern, classic monospace designs, including Operator, Input, Atlas, Nitti, Gintronic, and Covik Mono.
  - If you are committed to an open-source route and you aren't quite sure about Recursive Mono, IBM Plex Mono is libre, beautiful, and a must-try. Hack Mono is also lovely – taking the classic Bitstream Vera body and adding a few code-specific typographic improvements.
  - I am not trying to displace other good coding fonts. Rather, I hope to expand the wider typographic audience & environment to be more interesting, more expressive, and more open to variable fonts.

## Improvements made for Google Fonts release

- I knew I needed to remove some overlaps to improve text rendering. To meet Google Fonts standards, I also needed to extend the character set, adding more currency symbols, adding support for Vietnamese, and other such additions. Should I change it more than this?
- One designer's advice: "Don't change it much. Use your new ideas on future projects." Sound advice. I had already sold the font to a client. Why put in more work?
- Another designer asked me: "Do you think you will really have the freedom you want if you publish through Google fonts?"
- Goaded on by the second question, I decided to ignore the advice to take the short road. I set about adding a more cursive italic lowercase, giving many more curves to slanted forms, designing inktraps, removing problematic overlaps, and refining basically everything. And adding code ligatures.
- It was a lot of work to do! Luckily, I was able to get help from some awesome collaborators. Katja, Lisa, and Rafał.

### Removing overlaps for better rendering at text sizes

- During TypeMedia, I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally. However, I realized right after TypeMedia that while this approach did enhance my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, it had a critical flaw in use: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way.

### Added contrast and curves for more personality

- After stepping away from really looking at Recursive at large sizes for awhile, and then coming back, I realized that it had way less contrast than I wanted it to. This helped make things feel consistent, but they didn't feel _right._
- It was a challenge to determine exactly _how much_ contrast and personality things should have. I had to push things too far before I could understand where simplicity was helping the design, and where it was holding it back.

[IMAGE OF EXPERIMENTS THAT WENT TOO FAR]

- Ultimately, I determined that adding lots of curves worked well in slanted, casual forms, but less well in the upright casual or in the linear styles. Really, this family originated in a style that is meant to be painted at a slant, with curves in every stem. Embracing this more in the slanted Casual styles gave the typeface an even wider range of expression, and adds more spice to the type family. I kept horizontal curves flat to keep a solid link to the typographic nature of the project, but put curves into nearly all vertical strokes to better follow the movement of a brush.

### A more-cursive (but still disconnected) italic lowercase

- A more fun and unique italic.
- Bringing these from a stylistic set into their own ital axis, for easier control and less font weight than stylistic sets.

### Inktraps

– If you look closely at modern type releases, you will see that many of them (or maybe nearly all of them) have _inktraps,_ which are little flattened corners in the whitespace of letters – these are especially common in acute angles such as the joint in an `n` or the vertices in a `W`. Historically, these were added spaces cut into the corners to increase legibility in fonts which would be printed in ink. The ink would tend to spread out from the printing, filling in such corners to make them crisp. In digital fonts, it is debatable whether inktraps really serve much of a purpose of aiding legibility in text sizes. I, for one, find that they are only really noticeable in the contrast they add to joints. This does add some drama at text sizes, but in my eyes, the real benefit of inktraps comes at much larger sizes. Inktraps are a visual hack that tacitly signals, "This typeface is carefully drawn. Every curve and every corner has been considered." In "Graphic Design 101" language, inktraps enhance figure-ground integration by shaping the whitespace in a way that reflects the form of the letters.

- I had already cut the point ends of strokes in an homage to Verdana, so it felt natural to reflect this stroke blunting with similar cuts to inner corners. The cuts were somewhat small on the Casual styles, and big enough to be slightly absurd – but not big enough to be distracting – in the Linear styles. I matched these cuts in the strokes with cuts into the whitespace.
- Me, in March: How hard can it be to add inktraps?
- Me, now: very hard. Inktraps seem like a small decision, but actually, inktraps are very challenging to do right. How big should they be? How consistent in size? Angle? What about in different Glyphs? Different masters?

### General Refinements

- Things were drawn quickly at TypeMedia because I needed to cover a lot of ground in just a few months, so tons of things were bothering me. Lumpy curves, asymmetrical glyphs that should be symmetrical, not-quite ideal proportions, almost no kerning in sans beyond a proof of concept.

- Softer stroke endings

[IMAGE: STROKE ENDINGS of w/v/x/y, BEFORE AND AFTER]

- intermediate glyphs drawings, where useful

[IMAGE: EXAMPLE OF /w WITH AND WITHOUT INTERMEDIATE MASTERS (a phrase like web message)]

- Rafał helped develop two important tools
  - Master compatibility, to help find and correct incompatible glyph drawings
  - To be compatible for interpolation, all drawings of a glyph must have the exact same number of points. This is even harder for variable fonts than for traditional static fonts, so Master Compatibility was essential for finding where problems were, and fixing them.

[IMAGE OF MASTER COMPATIBILITY]

- Glyph Mirror, to make it much faster to draw symmetrica contours where desired
- Most fonts are subtly asymmetrical in many ways. For Recursive's Linear styles, I wanted to add more symmetry than usual, to make it just a bit more mechanical and rational than most fonts. Glyph Mirror helped me achieve this by placing a live, mirrored drawing of the current glyph behind itself. Even when I want to make a glyph with subtle asymmetry for visual harmony, this can be extremely helpful in allowing me to know _exactly how asymmetrical_ my drawing is, and to more-quickly achieve the right balance.

[IMAGE OF ROUND CHARACTERS, COMPARING SYMMETRY BEFORE/AFTER]

- During TypeMedia, I made a simple Chrome Extension to inject any font into any website. This was very helpful, but limited in its performance and functionality. I was lucky enough to work with @PixelAmbacht to take this idea and completely redesign and re-implement it. It is now far more seamless across web pages and is much more flexible for usage with multiple fonts. So, beyond just giving me a better way to test in-progress versions of Recursive, it has also given me a new way to enjoy other fonts on my system!

A big bonus of this project: these tools are all open-source!

### Code ligatures

- Code ligatures are controversial among type designers. Typographically, they have several easy-to-identify problems. Most notably, they make code harder for the uninitiated to read. How do you know what syntax you're looking at if the characters in that syntax have changed? For example, `<=` is technically two separate unicode symbols, and even though it means "less than or equal to" in several coding languages, it is certainly different, unicode-wise, than the character `≤`.
- However, in [a (somewhat non-scientific) Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/ThunderNixon/status/1108416704961499143), 21% of 780+ respondents said they "won't code without 'em." Some of the people who said this are coders I really look up to, so I couldn't just dismiss them off-hand.
- Why are they useful? They are like syntax highlighting. They help coders to see that they have typed the right thing in the moment, and to visually scan their code more easily later on
- Worked with Rafał on early designs of this. Principles: better chunking (things with a combined meaning should be "one unit" even if they don't physically connect, such as `||` or `**`), more recognizability, and improving legibility.
- Crowdfunding this part so Rafał and I can finish these. Google will match contributions!
