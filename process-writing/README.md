# Major stages & decisions in recursive

_Written by Stephen Nixon & Noemi Stauffer_


## Goals of the project
- Making something that would provide the most fun and utility to web developers and designers
- Showing people what is possible with variable fonts, beyond the usual "weight, width, optical size" story that people tend to focus on
- Chasing a personal curiosity: what would a "casual script" for code should look like?

## Before

- Grew up loving letters. Excited to learn graphic design was a career path. Went to school for it. Excited to learn type had a career path, and programs like TypeMedia existed.
- After undergrad, I worked at IBM for 3 years as a designer, while designing fonts & lettering on the side.

- At IBM, I was a visual designer for software, and then a brand experience designer. 
  - While designing software, my longest-running project was on a team making financial dashboards for executives. Amongst many other things, I learned a ton about using type (Helvetica Neue, at that time) for software interfaces. I grew to understand its many strengths and limitations. There were obvious things: its tight spacing and small apertures made it hard to read at small sizes, and its default figures weren't tabular and so it was hard to use in data-heavy tables. However, there were also less-obvious limitations. Each font style took up different widths, so I found that we couldn't change styles (say, go from Regular to Bold) to show state in menus or links. It didn't have a matching monospace font, so even if I did want to use a monospace font for tabular data or to present strings like passwords or git commits, these wouldn't match the sizing or style of our primary type.
  - I started working as a brand experience designer in IBM's Watson division at a really good time: the company's core brand team was just started to roll out new branding for Watson, and I was able to help implement this on everything from conference merch to Watson webpages to app icons. Around the same time, IBM also started to change over from Helvetica to IBM Plex, an incredible type family designed for IBM by Mike Abbink and Bold Monday. Getting to work with Plex was a total delight: it took a fresh look at IBM's rich design history, but offered a solution tailored to suit the huge range of needs across software, web, and services. Even better, Mike Abbink and IBM's core brand team used the introduction of Plex to transform the company's visual & graphic design as a whole. This showed me first-hand how transformative it can be to have type that is well-suited to the task of design & communications for software and for the web. 
  - Through my time at IBM, I also learned a lot beyond typography. I was a designer rather than a developer, but the projects I worked often worked best when I got closer to the code. Over my time there, I went from spending almost my design time in visual design tools to spending almost half of my design time in code, bringing the design work from others into production CSS and prototyped JavaScript for developers to use in building marketing webpages.

- Beyond finding code to be a useful tool for design, I really love to code. I don't think it comes as naturally to me as it might to others, but when I solve a problem in code, it lights up my brain in a way that nothing else does. 

- Recently, I have been spending most of my coding time in Python and Shell scripts for QA & production in type design, but I have a special love of the web â€“ especially the people, communities, and philosophy of web development. I love the many fun, warm-hearted resources for people wanting to grow as web developers â€“ sites like CSS Tricks and MDN, tools like CodePen and CodeSandbox, frameworks like GatsbyJS, and podcasts like Syntax FM, Toolsday, and ShopTalkShow.

- Obviously, I also love making fonts. Making websites and making fonts both feel "magical" to me, even though I understand that no, there's no magic involved â€“ both are the result of the work and thought of many brilliant people before me). Both pursuits give me a primordial sense of joy and pride. I get to feel not just "I MADE THIS THING," but also know that these things are digital & interactive. Others can take what I've made and use them in ways I couldn't have forseen. With open-source projects like Recursive, they can even take what I've made an adapt or remix my work in totally new ways. In these ways, the work becomes infinite.

- Ultimately, Recursive was a way to combine the things I love: brush scripts, UI design, coding, and exploring new technology.

- I designed Recursive in RoboFont, a font editor that is sometimes intimidating for newcomers, but really encourages customization of one's workflow with scripts, extensions, and the UFO (Unified Font Object) file format. Throughout the project, I coded as a way to automate my workflow, generate versions and proofs of the work-in-progress, test my many files for similarity and quality, build design files into working variable fonts, and use the output fonts in web experiments. Along the way, I used the versions of Recursive Mono as the font for my coding. This, in turn, helped me to test the font itself, find issues to improve. By using the font outputs as a tool to produce the font, I was working _recursively_ â€“ using outputs as inputs to achieve a result that would have otherwise been impossible.

## Context

- TypeMedia is... (Explain basic legacy of program, plus semester 1 courses)
- TypeMedia is known for producing projects that are experimental, but often very rooted in the idea of type coming from handwritten strokes. Often, projects include styles for both display and text.
- Outsiders tend to think of fonts in a way that is very limited, and largely driven by a "Microsoft Word" categorization of type: one style in "RIBBI"
- Historically, type had different styles for every size, sure in part to the tools of punch cutting, but also to knowledge of the human reader. Many styles were combined within compositions (show examples?)

## Start

- Sketching the idea. Wanting to do many styles in a big monospace family.
- Based this on "casual script," a style of signpainting that I've long been enamored with, and wanted to learn more about

[ADD IMAGES OF CASUAL SCRIPT]

- Prototyping atop Plex mono to test the idea. I also tested another totally different idea (which I still intend to make as a future project), but ultimately went with this weirder one. YOt]mO!

[IMAGE OF FIRST PROTOTYPE]

- Scrapping the prototype, but largely keeping the metrics to stay consistent with other mono fonts. Allows fallbacks during design phase

[IMAGE OF EARLY PROTOTYPE WITH FALLBACKS]

- Early drawings. Searching for something both expressive and simple/typographic. Tried to explore this by making something too wild, and something too rigid. Realized that having a spectrum was more interesting than finding just one thing in the middle. I recieved some excellent feedback from a couple of type designers I look up to especially, and this gave me a boost of ideas to refine the letterforms â€“ making them wild but not _too_ wild, and straightforward but not naÃ¯ve.

## Development at TypeMedia

- Inventing my own casual alphabet, with different brushes and pens. Taking uppercase forms into a roman lowercase. Lots of sketching with brush pens led me to find some details that aren't common from professional signpainters, but which I think work well, anyway. Little "kicks" are added to letters like `R` and `K`, but left out of lowercase letters like `k` and `x`, to improve readability (because the vast majority of running text is set in lowercase).

[SKETCHES]

- Narrowing focus. Experimenting with connected scripts and blackletters, but leaving these aside out of (a small amount) of practicality.

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF DIFFERENT STYLES]

- Expanding weight range. The heavy was too good to ignore. Most type designers say that the weight range of monospace designs are limited by what complex characters can do. I disagree. ðŸ˜ˆ "Sporklike" contrast and overall color
  - I initially worked on a grid that sought to make this typeface "pixel fit" at 10px on a retina screen. (This is a classic way for fonts to start, only for the designer to realize that grid-fitting is a slightly silly goal for fonts, as they will show up at all sizes on all manner of screen resolutions, and rendering technology is made to optimize shapes as much as possible, for each device.)
  - Still, this 20-unit grid approach did help me to come to a decision on the "Designspace," or stylistic range of the type family. The lightest weight is drawn so that strokes take up roughly 1/20th of their total height, so that fonts can be as light as possible while avoiding super-light text which is that so often the bane of readability on the web. The heaviest weight is drawn so that counters (the white spaces in the middle of letters) take up 1/20th of the text block â€“ making something as heavy as possible while retaining legibility at screen text sizes.

[IMAGES: EARLY EXPLORATIONS OF HEAVY STYLES]

- Finding the right balance of personality and typographic harmony.

  - How big should corner curves be?
  - How much overshoot should stroke connections have?

- Making curviness match between letters like /n and /o â€“ finding that low connections and bouncy contrast could help with this

[IMAGES: EARLY /n & /o VERSUS CURRENT /n & /o (maybe a word like `sonorous`?)]

- Made a chrome extension to inject my font into any page, and read with it. (This has since been turned into Type-X, but more on this later).

[EARLY VERSION OF TYPE-X][current version of type-x]

- Paying attention to text rendering by using the fonts. Smoothing kinks from Linear styles to make them as seemlessly readable as possible â€“ avoiding visual "breaks" or whitespots in letters
- Making a sans by scripting some Glyphs to copy over but leaving others to draw/adjust
- Producing materials for the TypeMedia thesis: specimens, poster, process book, and a simple web type tester

## After TypeMedia

- Further developing the recursive minisite as a way to better understand react/Gatsby and as a better way to show the project to others
- Making my TypeMedia class website
- I started freelancing, primarily at Google Fonts, working on variable font upgrades and onboarding, to upgrade existing fonts like Encode, and onboard new, popular fonts like Fira Code and Inter.
- I established my type design & development company, Arrow Type (named for some of the most useful but most-often forgotten glyphs in type design).
- Discovered a critical issue with Recursive that I had missed TypeMedia by only working on a 4K monitor. I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally, overlapping contours in each letter to mimick the strokes of a brush, painting these letters. This approach enhanced my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, but it had a major drawback on lower-resolution screens: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way. This was due to each contour getting "antialiased," and these partially-lit pixels overlapping and adding up in value.

## Deciding to release through Google Fonts

- I had been planning to work on Recursive as a side project, and eventually release it either through Arrow Type or through a more establish type foundry. However, because Google Fonts is in the process of pushing their library further into the realm of variable fonts, they offered to sponsor me to finish Recursive and release it sooner, as an OFL (open-source) font.
- In the type industry, Google Fonts is somewhat controversial. Does it devalue the industry to have so many free options? I discussed my options with a few trusted type designers.
- Ultimately, I decided that for Recursive, Google Fonts was an ideal place to release. This typeface is for coders of all abilities and experiences, code documentation, and to push new ideas forward in variable type on the web, software, and end users. It could be a niche product that i made a side project for 5 years, or it could make an impact and be published within 2019.
- As a quick plug for commercially-released type: as biased as I am towards Recursive, there are still lots of benefits in favor of buying type. If you are branding a company, the typeface you select will do a lot of work to help or hinder your ability to communicate, connect, and differentiate. This is a choice that should be carefully considered for every project, and ultimately, the cost of licensing type is almost always extremely reasonable for the value it can add to a project.
  - In the realm of Recursive, if you are a professional coder, you probably spend hours every day with your chosen monospace font as your primary interface. You (or your employer) probably paid some good money to buy a computer, an office chair, and a desk that would allow you to maximize focus and productivity. It's worth finding (and buying, if applicable) a typeface that is best for you and can do the same! There are a number of _masterful,_ modern, classic monospace designs, including Operator, Input, Atlas, Nitti, Gintronic, and Covik Mono.
  - If you are committed to an open-source route and you aren't quite sure about Recursive Mono, IBM Plex Mono is libre, beautiful, and a must-try. Hack Mono is also lovely â€“ taking the classic Bitstream Vera body and adding a few code-specific typographic improvements.
  - I am not trying to displace other good coding fonts. Rather, I hope to expand the wider typographic audience & environment to be more interesting, more expressive, and more open to variable fonts.

## Improvements made for Google Fonts release

- I knew I needed to remove some overlaps to improve text rendering. To meet Google Fonts standards, I also needed to extend the character set, adding more currency symbols, adding support for Vietnamese, and other such additions. Should I change it more than this?
- One designer's advice: "Don't change it much. Use your new ideas on future projects." Sound advice. I had already sold the font to a client. Why put in more work?
- Another designer asked me: "Do you think you will really have the freedom you want if you publish through Google fonts?"
- Goaded on by the second question, I decided to ignore the advice to take the short road. I set about adding a more cursive italic lowercase, giving many more curves to slanted forms, designing inktraps, removing problematic overlaps, and refining basically everything. And adding code ligatures.
- It was a lot of work to do! Luckily, I was able to get help from some awesome collaborators. Katja, Lisa, and RafaÅ‚.

### Removing overlaps for better rendering at text sizes

- During TypeMedia, I drew Recursive in such a way that took the idea of designing with "The Stroke" in mind very literally. However, I realized right after TypeMedia that while this approach did enhance my design approach in some ways and gave me flexibility to think differently about what I was drawing, it had a critical flaw in use: overlaps showed up as little "blobs" on the outlines of letters, leading text to be subtly distorted in an unflattering way.

### Added contrast and curves for more personality

- After stepping away from really looking at Recursive at large sizes for awhile, and then coming back, I realized that it had way less contrast than I wanted it to. This helped make things feel consistent, but they didn't feel _right._
- It was a challenge to determine exactly _how much_ contrast and personality things should have. I had to push things too far before I could understand where simplicity was helping the design, and where it was holding it back.

[IMAGE OF EXPERIMENTS THAT WENT TOO FAR]

- Ultimately, I determined that adding lots of curves worked well in slanted, casual forms, but less well in the upright casual or in the linear styles. Really, this family originated in a style that is meant to be painted at a slant, with curves in every stem. Embracing this more in the slanted Casual styles gave the typeface an even wider range of expression, and adds more spice to the type family. I kept horizontal curves flat to keep a solid link to the typographic nature of the project, but put curves into nearly all vertical strokes to better follow the movement of a brush.

### A more-cursive (but still disconnected) italic lowercase

- A more fun and unique italic.
- Bringing these from a stylistic set into their own ital axis, for easier control and less font weight than stylistic sets.

### Inktraps

â€“ If you look closely at modern type releases, you will see that many of them (or maybe nearly all of them) have _inktraps,_ which are little flattened corners in the whitespace of letters â€“ these are especially common in acute angles such as the joint in an `n` or the vertices in a `W`. Historically, these were added spaces cut into the corners to increase legibility in fonts which would be printed in ink. The ink would tend to spread out from the printing, filling in such corners to make them crisp. In digital fonts, it is debatable whether inktraps really serve much of a purpose of aiding legibility in text sizes. I, for one, find that they are only really noticeable in the contrast they add to joints. This does add some drama at text sizes, but in my eyes, the real benefit of inktraps comes at much larger sizes. Inktraps are a visual hack that tacitly signals, "This typeface is carefully drawn. Every curve and every corner has been considered." In "Graphic Design 101" language, inktraps enhance figure-ground integration by shaping the whitespace in a way that reflects the form of the letters.

- I had already cut the point ends of strokes in an homage to Verdana, so it felt natural to reflect this stroke blunting with similar cuts to inner corners. The cuts were somewhat small on the Casual styles, and big enough to be slightly absurd â€“ but not big enough to be distracting â€“ in the Linear styles. I matched these cuts in the strokes with cuts into the whitespace.
- Me, in March: How hard can it be to add inktraps?
- Me, now: very hard. Inktraps seem like a small decision, but actually, inktraps are very challenging to do right. How big should they be? How consistent in size? Angle? What about in different Glyphs? Different masters?

### General Refinements

- Things were drawn quickly at TypeMedia because I needed to cover a lot of ground in just a few months, so tons of things were bothering me. Lumpy curves, asymmetrical glyphs that should be symmetrical, not-quite ideal proportions, almost no kerning in sans beyond a proof of concept.

- Softer stroke endings

[IMAGE: STROKE ENDINGS of w/v/x/y, BEFORE AND AFTER]

- intermediate glyphs drawings, where useful

[IMAGE: EXAMPLE OF /w WITH AND WITHOUT INTERMEDIATE MASTERS (a phrase like web message)]

- RafaÅ‚ helped develop two important tools
  - Master compatibility, to help find and correct incompatible glyph drawings
  - To be compatible for interpolation, all drawings of a glyph must have the exact same number of points. This is even harder for variable fonts than for traditional static fonts, so Master Compatibility was essential for finding where problems were, and fixing them.

[IMAGE OF MASTER COMPATIBILITY]

- Glyph Mirror, to make it much faster to draw symmetrica contours where desired
- Most fonts are subtly asymmetrical in many ways. For Recursive's Linear styles, I wanted to add more symmetry than usual, to make it just a bit more mechanical and rational than most fonts. Glyph Mirror helped me achieve this by placing a live, mirrored drawing of the current glyph behind itself. Even when I want to make a glyph with subtle asymmetry for visual harmony, this can be extremely helpful in allowing me to know _exactly how asymmetrical_ my drawing is, and to more-quickly achieve the right balance.

[IMAGE OF ROUND CHARACTERS, COMPARING SYMMETRY BEFORE/AFTER]

- During TypeMedia, I made a simple Chrome Extension to inject any font into any website. This was very helpful, but limited in its performance and functionality. I was lucky enough to work with @PixelAmbacht to take this idea and completely redesign and re-implement it. It is now far more seamless across web pages and is much more flexible for usage with multiple fonts. So, beyond just giving me a better way to test in-progress versions of Recursive, it has also given me a new way to enjoy other fonts on my system!

### Code ligatures

- Code ligatures are controversial among type designers. Typographically, they have several easy-to-identify problems. Most notably, they make code harder for the uninitiated to read. How do you know what syntax you're looking at if the characters in that syntax have changed? For example, `<=` is technically two separate unicode symbols, and even though it means "less than or equal to" in several coding languages, it is certainly different, unicode-wise, than the character `â‰¤`.
- However, in [a (somewhat non-scientific) Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/ThunderNixon/status/1108416704961499143), 21% of 780+ respondents said they "won't code without 'em." Some of the people who said this are coders I really look up to, so I couldn't just dismiss them off-hand.
- Why are they useful? They are like syntax highlighting. They help coders to see that they have typed the right thing in the moment, and to visually scan their code more easily later on
- Worked with RafaÅ‚ on early designs of this. Principles: better chunking (things with a combined meaning should be "one unit" even if they don't physically connect, such as `||` or `**`), more recognizability, and improving legibility.
- Crowdfunding this part so RafaÅ‚ and I can finish these. Google will match contributions!
