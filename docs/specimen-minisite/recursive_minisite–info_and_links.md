**Grainy Colors**

Beautiful [illustrations by Elliot Salazar](https://www.elliotsalazar.com/#/trip-sitting-tips/):

(If this graininess were applied to a glowing/moving gradient, that would be suuuuper cool)

## “Weird” design

**Nothing in particular, but we could connect glyph contour nodes with lines, to show interpolation**

**Fun weird site designs**

## Product Websites

**Stripe**
The animated pieces of UI work nicely with explanations. Stripe has a lot of nice CSS touches, overall.

**iOS 12**
Lots of images of product UI. Attractive pace of explanation with great copywriting – catchy titles with easy-to-read explanations of around 200–500 characters.

**Sketch**
Beautiful sense of drama and fun, with the dark backgrounds and bright pops of color.

## Type Specimens

**GT Eesti Design**
Beautiful, up-close look at characters & design features. Good example of video animations to show type variations (probably a better solution than using actual font animations, as those will crash browsers right now). The site is overall a good example of flow: story, design, origins, try/buy.

**Halyard**
Really excellent set of SVG illustrations of a wide range of suggested uses. Makes it easy to imagine where the family could be used in other graphic design work.

## Type Experiments

**Amazing interactive way to draw with type.**

**ASCII Art**
Obviously, ASCII art is a great use case for monospace type. This is a nice example of that:

**Even better ASCII Art**

**Not quite sure what this is, but it’s a nice animation.**

## Docs / code-based blogs

**Styled Components**
Fun aesthetic. Was better with Operator Mono.

https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#animations

**React**
Not especially fun; just really nicely done.

https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

**CSS Tricks**
Frequent redesigns. Uses nice CSS tricks, like the gradient backgrounds for hovered text, and subtle/not-subtle hover states.
